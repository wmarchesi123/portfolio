# Portfolio Site v1 - William Marchesi

A few weeks ago, thinking about how I could best set myself apart from other students and job applicants, I decided it would be good to build a website to showcase my skills and experience. 

In addition, I developed the site in about a week, with myself going from knowing no React.js to having a fully functioning portfolio I can be proud to show prospective employers. While I already was proficient in HTML, CSS, and PHP, I thought it would be best to showcase my ability to adapt to a new environment and language and apply my previous knowledge to the challenge in front of me.

Below, anyone can view the public GitHub repository for the site to follow along with my week of development. Going forward, I will continue to refine and improve this site to showcase my current position and experience.
